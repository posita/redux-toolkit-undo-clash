# Test case for [omnidan/redux-undo#272](https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo/issues/272)

To run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/posita/redux-toolkit-undo-clash.git
cd redux-toolkit-undo-clash
yarn install
yarn test
```

Look at the comments in `src/slice.test.tsx` on how to get the tests to pass (which should illustrate the bug).
